With the depreciation of the Twitter API V1, this code no longer works. Additionally, because much of the geoprocessing code is relevant to my unfinished thesis, I have elected to not include any of the analysis code. Once the streaming code has been updaed to work with Twitter API V1.1 and authentication I will upload the code for streaming and import.
