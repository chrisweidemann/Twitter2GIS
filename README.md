With the depreciation of the Twitter API V1, this code no longer works. Additionally, because much of the geoprocessing code is relevant to my unfinished thesis, I have elected to not include any of the analysis code. Once the streaming code has been updated to work with Twitter API V1.1 I will reupload the code for streaming and import.

If you do not want to wait around for an update from me, ESRI's soon to be released GeoEvent Processor for Server will allow the collection of Tweets.
